### Use

[Feature-sliced methodology for project structure](https://feature-sliced.design/en/)

[React-native-safe-area-context for Header](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context)

[React Native Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)

I didn't use **React native reanimated** for animation because of the condition about avoiding 3rd-party libraries
